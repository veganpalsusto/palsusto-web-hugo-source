_Conchas_ --translates to shells-- are the most famous Mexican sweet bread rolls. 
We offer our two [award winning](https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/post/23-03-01-palsusto-vca/) 
**classic** flavours of vegan conchas: cacao and vanilla. 
Our other staple product is 
the adorable [_Marranito_](https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/post/23-10-05-palsusto-vca/), a type of pan dulce is reminiscent of gingerbread biscuit.
We want to showcase and celebrate mexican tradition, which is why we created our **seasonal**
range, at the moment featuring the two most important breads: the [_Pan de Muerto_](https://veganpalsusto.co.uk/post/23-10-05-palsusto-vca/) and the 
_Rosca de Reyes_.
Sometimes we do some **limited** editions with lovely decorations, they will appear 
at special occasions, or some holidays.
Be on the lookout for these!
