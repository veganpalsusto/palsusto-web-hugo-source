We are very happy to announce that two of our new products the iconic _Pan de Muerto_ and the adorable _Marranito_, received this honour!

<!--more-->

Louise Jane, CEO of [The Vegan Choice Awards](https://www.veganchoiceawards.com) 
was kind to share the following words with about our products:


## Pan de Muerto:

 _If you're looking for something delectable to help you celebrate the Day of the Dead, Pa'l Susto's Vegan Pan de Muerto is hard to beat. This mouthwatering bread will make your taste buds sing!_
 _It's so much more than just a delicious treat. It's an opportunity to connect with Mexican culture, especially when you learn all about the special tradition and history behind this irresistible, zesty, sugar-topped delight._

_I loved the taste so much that this product has become a permanent part of my life, and I highly recommend checking this incredible company out if you're looking for a sweet connection to the spirit (and otherworldly deliciousness!!!)_

## Marranitos

**I'm a huge fan of all of the sweet offerings from Paâ€™l Susto, and these marranitos are no exception!**

_Like everything else from this brand, these are baked to absolute perfection. They're similar to gingerbread, but even tastier, and they have this incredible texture that's somewhere between cake and a cookie. I've always thought of pigs as a symbol of luck, so these little piggies are a surefire way to spread good vibes._

_Forget milk and cookies: Milk and marranitos are the way forward! If you haven't tried them before, these marranitos are really the best you'll find anywhere! And they're completely Vegan!_
